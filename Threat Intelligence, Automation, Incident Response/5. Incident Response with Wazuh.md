It is utmost importance to have a rapid and efficient response plan in place to handle any security events that may arise in the ever-changing world of cybersecurity. For example, a sales employee opened up a malicious file with a name attached to an email pretending to be from an authorized business partner. This can result in a ransomware attack and bring down many mission-criticalservices. When such an incident happens, responding promptly can help to minimize the overall damage to the network. An efficient incident response (IR) can help businesses to promptly resume normal operations, thereby reducing the amount of downtime that occurs and the expenses connected with it.

In this chapter, we will learn how to leverage the Wazuh platform and other Wazuh-supported thirdparty tools to build an effective IR system. We will cover the following topics in this chapter:
- Introduction to incident response
- What is Wazuh active response?
- Blocking unauthorized SSH access
- Isolating an infected Windows machine
- Blocking RDP brute-force attack attempts

## 1. Introduction to Incident Response

Incident response is the process by which an organization handles a security incident, DDos attack, or data breach. It is an effort to immediately identify an attack, mitigate the impact of the attack, contain any damage caused by the attack, and fix the cause in order to reduce the risk of future attacks. In practice, IR refers to a collection of information security rules, processes, and tools that can be used to detect, contain, and remove intrusions.Let’s discuss the two most popular IR frameworks, the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and SANS**, as shown in the following diagram.

### Different Incident Response Methods

There are various methods for developing a structed IR process. There are two IR frameworks and processes that are most popular: NIST and SANS. Let us see each of them in detail.

#### SANS six-step incident response process

The SANS Institute recommends six precesses for IR: *preparation, indentification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.*

Let’s elaborate on the SANS six-step procedure. SANS defines IR as having six stages. When an incident occurs, these six processes are repeated in a cycle. The steps are as follows:
1. Preparation of systems and procedures
2. Identification of incidents
3. Containment of attack
4. Eradication of intrusion
5. Recovery from accidents, including system restoration
6. Lessons gained and feedback applied to the next stage of planning

Let us understand each of these steps in detail.

1. **Preparation:** During the first step of preparation, you evaluate the efficiency of exitsting security measures and regulations. This entails doing a risk assessment to identify current vulnerabilities and the priority of your assets. Some of the important action items are listed here:
- Create a policy and plan for IR
- Create a team for IR
- Determine and categorize important assets
- Acquire the tools and technologies needed for IR

2. **Indentification of incidents:** The emphasis is on the constant monitoring and identification of potential security issues using techniques such as IDSs, SIEM, EDR, and log analysis. SOme of the important action items are listed here:
- Continuous suveillance for indications of security incidents
- Use host-based and network-based intrusion detection systems
- Gather and examine logs from various sources
- Make use of threat intelligence streams

3. **Containment of attack:** When an incident occurs, this phase focuses on immediately isolating compromised systems, implementing temporary solutions or workarounds, and updating access restrictions and firewall rules to avoid additional compromises. This is where digital forensics plays a crucial role.

4. **Eradication of intrusion**: The incident’s root cause is recognized and treated here. Vulnerabilities that allowed the incident to occur are remedied, and policies and configurations are modified to prevent the same occurrence from occurring again.
5. **Recovery from accidents, including system restoration:** This phase focuses on resuming the normal operation of affected
systems, certifying their integrity, and ensuring that the incident has been thoroughly resolved. It also entails analyzing and upgrading IR processes depending on the incident’s lessons gained.
6. **Lessons learned phase:** During this phase, organizations undertake a post-event review, documenting the incident, the reaction, and the lessons learned. The purpose is to develop IR plans and policies, as well as to offer IR team members additional training.

#### NIST incident response process

NIST defines IR as having four steps: preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery, and post-incident activity. Let us understand each of these processes in detail:

1. **Preparation:** The NIST framework for IR emphasizes preparation as a critical component, much like the SANS framework does. During this phase, systems, procedures, and plans must be put in place in order to get ready for incidents. Organizations should have the following in place to be ready for incidents:
- A precise IR strategy
- Clearly defined roles and duties
- A successful communication strategy
- Reporting plan
- Determining the vital systems and resources
- Testing and updating the IR plan on a regular basis

2. **Detection and analysis:** During this phase, companies identify and examine occurrences to comprehend their extent and consequences. Making decisions regarding how to respond to an incident at this time is crucial. The following should be in place inside businesses in order to recognize and analyze occurrences effectively:
- Keeping an eye on escalation processes and mechanisms
- Prompt incident detection and analysis

3. **Containment, eradication, and recovery:** : The containment, eradication, and recovery stages in the NIST framework are similar to those in the SANS framework. The following should be in place inside organizations in order to contain, eliminate, and recover from incidents:
- Isolating the impacted systems
- Eliminating the incident’s root cause
- Returning to regular operations

4. **Post-incident activity:** In the NIST system, post-incident activity is the last phase. Organizations evaluate their IR procedure and evaluate the effects of incidents at this point. The following should be in place for organizations to examine and enhance the IR process:
- A procedure to evaluate the incident method
- A process for recording the lessons discovered
- A plan for bringing enhancements to the IR procedure into practice

#### Objectives of the NIST and SANS procedures

The objectives of the NIST and SANS IR frameworks are similar and offer an organized method for handling incidents. Nonetheless, the two frameworks differ in a few significant ways:
- Both frameworks emphasize the significance of having a precise IR plan, defined roles and duties, and efficient communication
when it comes to the preparation stage. On the other hand, having a reporting plan in place and identifying key systems and
assets are given more weight in the NIST framework.
- Both frameworks concentrate on the prompt detection and examination of occurrences in terms of detection and analysis. But whereas the NIST framework is more concerned with monitoring systems and escalation protocols, the SANS approach prioritizes triage and prioritizing.

### Incident Response Automation

Effective IR is time-sensitive and requires teams to identify threats and initiate an incident response plan (IRP) as soon as possible. A security team receives thousands of security alerts from security tools every day and hence it is difficult to manually analyze events or assess every alarm that security tools generate. These constraints are addressed via automated IR. In Chapter 4, Security Automation and Orchestration Using Shuffle, we learned how shuffle SOAR makes this possible by creating workflows, helping the security team with automated incident enrichment, automated observable analysis with TheHive tool integration, automating Wazuh activities, and many more. In this chapter, our focus will be on using Wazuh’s in-built capability called active response to perform IR. In general, IR automation can help the security team with the following:
- **Immediate containment:** Once compromised systems are identified, automated IR systems should isolate them to stop threats from spreading.
- **Dynamic firewall rules:** In response to certain risks, the IR automation system can dynamically develop and deploy firewall rules that block malicious traffic or isolate vulnerable systems
- **Automated account disabling:** Automated reaction steps can quickly disable compromised user accounts in the case of a security incident, blocking future unauthorized access
- **User access restrictions:** To improve the security posture, the IR automation system can impose access controls, such as
removing users who indicate suspicious behavior or restricting access privileges
- **GeoIP blocking:** To strengthen defense against targeted attacks, automated IR can use GeoIP blocking rules to limit access from particular geographic regions known for malicious activity

We can create tons of different use cases for automating IR. In the next section, we will practically deploy and test some of the automated IR using Wazuh’s active response capability.

## 2. Wazuh Active Response

One of the main component of the Wazuh platform that enables automatic response to security event and incidents is called active response. Security analysts can respond quickly to specific security threats or triggers identified by the Wazuh system by utilizing active response. By utilizing active response features, Wazuh enables organizations to respond to security incidents quickly and aggressively. With Wazuh active response, you may develop and execute automated responses against most security alerts. These responses may include executing custom scripts, banning IP addresses, or deactivating user accounts. Automating response actions makes sure that incidents with a high significance are dealt with and mitigated in a timely and consistent way. This is especially helpful when security teams don’t have a lot of resources and have to decide how to respond first. 

In this section, we will cover the following topics:
- Active response scripts
- Configuring active response
- The working of Wazuh active response

### Active Response Scripts

Wazuh provides pre-built Active response scripts for Linux, Windows, and macOS systems. Additionally, it also helps security professionals to write custom active response scripts based on specific requirements. The default active response scripts are stored in the following folders/directories:

| Endpoint Location | Directory/Folder                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Windows**        | `C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\active-response\bin` |
| **Linux**          | `/var/ossec/active-response/bin`             |
| **macOS**          | `/Library/ossec/active-response/bin`         |

The Wazuh team and entire community have done a brilliant job in building powerful active response scripts. Some of the most popular active response scripts are:
 

| **Operating System** | **Scripts** |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Windows**          | - **Netsh.exe**: Blocks an IP address using `netsh`  <br> - **Restart-wazuh.exe**: Restarts the Wazuh agent  <br> - **Route-null.exe**: Adds an IP address to the null route |
| **Ubuntu**           | - **firewall-drop**: Adds an IP address to the IP tables deny list  <br> - **start.sh**: Restarts the Wazuh agent or manager  <br> - **Route-null**: Adds an IP address to a null route |

Now, let's learn how to set up active response on the monitored endpoints.

### Configuring Active Response

Active response configuration needs to be done only on the Wazuh server. However, both the server and agent must have an active response script. Wazuh requires three things to execute an active response, and these are as follows:

- Active response script
- The `<command>` tag
- The `<active-response>` tag

#### Active Response Script

The Wazuh manager and agents have out-of-the-box active response scripts, supporting Linux, macOS, and Windows endpoints. We can also create custom active response scripts that run when an alert of a specific rule ID, rule group, or alert level triggers. All the default active response scripts are stored in the `/var/ossec/active-response/bin directory`. If you create a custom script, make sure you save them in the same directory

#### The `<command>` Tag

The `<command>` tag specifies which script should be executed when a certain rule is triggered. The `<command>` elements for out-of-the-box active response scripts are automatically included in the Wazuh server `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` instance type; therefore, it is not required to add them. Let me share an example of the `<command>` block:

```js
<command>
    <name>firewall-drop</name>
    <executable>firewall-drop</executable>
    <timeout_allowed>yes</timeout_allowed>
</command>
```

Here, We have the following:
- `<name>`: Name of the command
- `<executable>`: Defines the script or executable that must be executed in response to a trigger
- `<timeout_allowed>`: Enables a timeout following a specified duration.

#### The `<active-response>` Tag

Insert an `<active-response>` tag within the `<ossec_config>` element in the `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file of the same Wazuh server. The `<active-response>` block specifies the location and condition of command execution, as shown:

Here, we have the following:
- `<command>`:  It provides the configuration command. In our case, we have used firewall-drop
- `<location>`: It indicates the location where the command must be executed. We have three types of locations: **Local**,** Server**, or **Defined-agent**. The purpose of these options is as follows:
    - **Server**: It executes the script on the Wazuh server.
    - **Defined-agent**: It runs the script on a predefined agent. We require the  `<agent-id>` tag to specify the ID of the Wazuh agent.

### How Wazuh Active Response Works

These active response scripts (hosted at `/var/ossec/active-response/bin`) are run on monitored endpoints by Wazuh in response to alerts triggered by a particular rule ID, level, or rule group. You can write a variety of scripts to start in response to a trigger, but you need to carefully plan these actions. Inadequate execution of rules and replies may make an endpoint more vulnerable.

Let’s talk about how Wazuh active response works:

1. **Event generated:** The Wazuh agent pushes the events to the manager. The Wazuh manager analyzes and triggers alerts based on the matched rule.

![alt text]({FBE7F3FD-B1B6-4254-BB4B-67FAB4663FED}.png)

2. **Trigger active response:** Every security alert you see on the Wazuh dashboard is generated by the corresponding rule (prebuilt by Wazuh or custom). If you add an `<active-response>` block within the `<ossec_config>` tag in the Wazuh server with the `<rule_id>` tag and there is a matching security alert, it will trigger our newly created `<active-response>`.

3. **Responding to Wazuh agent:** Now, our Wazuh server will order the agent to perform an action defined by the <command> block. Wazuh agents will have the default active response scripts; however, if you want to implement any custom active response, you need to write and save the code in the Wazuh agent.

4. **Executing active response:** Active response scripts are stored within the Wazuh agent at the `/var/ossec/activeresponse/bin` location. You can troubleshoot or verify the Wazuh active response by checking the logs present at `/var/ossec/active-response/active-response.log`.

![alt text]({8E4BB02A-7C5B-4FDE-93EE-AB17F51E9FEC}.png)

5. **Active response alert:** Once the active response script is executed, our Wazuh manager will take that alert from the Wazuh agent and show it to us on the security alert dashboard.

Now that we understand how Wazuh active response works and how to configure it, let’s cover some practical use cases.

## 3. Blocking Unauthorized SSH Access

SSH attacks are among the most prevalent types of attacks against servers accessible via the internet. Automated bots that regularly monitor the internet for SSH servers with inadequate security setups carry out the major share of SSH attacks. Because attack sources are frequently scattered globally, with no single country dominating, it is a global cybersecurity threat. Organizational losses, data breaches, and compromised servers are all possible outcomes of successful SSH attacks. In this section, we will learn how to automatically block unauthorized SSH access to a victim’s machine.

### Lab Setup

In this lab setup, we require three things: an Ubuntu Server with a Wazuh agent installed, an attacker machine (Kali Linux), and, finally, our Wazuh server. The lab is designed as follows.

![alt text]({9304143A-6EAC-4B23-8F8F-44F641B09AED}.png)

In this lab, we are going to use the firewall-drop scripts as the default active response script for the monitored Ubuntu agent. Next, we need to modify the active response script to be triggered when an unauthorized SSH connection is detected.

### Setting Up Wazuh Active Response

In order to set up the Wazuh platform to block unauthorized SSH access attempts, we need to execute the firewall-drop active response script once Wazuh rule 5710 is triggered. We need to take the steps that follow to accomplish this task.

#### Modifying the active response on the Wazuh manager

As we have learned, `<active-response>` executes a specific `<command>` block. In our case, we are utilizing the firewall-drop active response, which executes the firewall-drop command. We can find both the `<command>` and `<active-response>` blocks in the `ossec.conf` file located at `/var/ossec/etc`. We want to make sure the `<active-response>` block for firewall-drop is executed once rule 5710 is triggered. Wazuh rule 5710 represents sshd: Attempt to login using a non-existent user. The final modified `<command>` and `<active-response>` blocks are shown here:
    
```js
<command>
    <name>firewall-drop</name>
    <executable>firewall-drop</executable>
    <timeout_allowed>yes</timeout_allowed>
</command>
<active-response>
    <command>firewall-drop</command>
    <location>local</location>
    <rules_id>5710</rules_id>
    <timeout>60</timeout>
</active-response>
```
Here, we have the following:
- `<executable>` :  It is set to **firewall-drop**, which indicates the name of the script located at `/var/ossec/active-response/bin` of the Wazuh agent.
- `<location>` : It is set to local, which indicates it only runs the script on the monitored endpoint that generated the alert
- `<timeout>` : It is set to **60** seconds and specifies that for 60 seconds the active response action will be effective.

### Testing and Visualizing Alerts

To test the unauthorized SSH brute-force attack, you can log in to a Kali Linux machine and run the following-mentioned hydra tool command:
```bash
hydra -l voldemort -P <PASSWORD_TEXT_FILE> <WAZUH_AGENT_IP> ssh
```
